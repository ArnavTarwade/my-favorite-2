        <p>I love to draw with different colours. Drawing gives me happiness. My most favourite time is when I come back from school because at that time I get free time to paint.I love to draw my mother and fatherâ€™s pictures on my notebook. They are my favourite drawings. I also love to paint fruits like mango, orange and banana. My mother motivates me to draw more and more.<br><br> In my school also, everyone loves my drawings. Whenever there is a school competition, my teachers call me to participate. In my home, there is a small room made by my father. In that room, I have kept all the pictures which I have drawn. I have drawn mango, cow, apple, banana and many more.

My mother and father always help me in getting coloured pencils, sketch pens etc. They become very happy because I do not waste time and do my drawing in free time. </p>
